Fountain is a plain text markup language for screenwriting.

Each line of syntax in a fountain screenplay can be classified as a particular fountain element. A fountain screenplay
line cannot have more than 1 classification.  When classifying elements, it's crucial to consider the context provided
 by the previous and next lines. The relationships between consecutive lines often determine the correct classification
  of elements in Fountain.

<rules>

<BlankLine>
"Blank Line": No text or punctuation.  
</BlankLine>

<SceneHeading>
"Scene Headings": Any line that begins with "INT", "INT.", "EXT", "EXT.", "EST" "EST.", "INT/EXT", "INT./EXT" or "I/E". A Scene Heading
always has at least one blank line preceding it and one blank line following it.  Any line that begins with a single leading period (.) forces 
"scene heading" classification.  Lines that begin with multiple periods ("...") are NOT classified as "scene heading".
wiht multiple periods ().  Scene Headings can optionally be appended with Scene Numbers. Scene numbers are any alphanumerics 
(plus dashes and periods), wrapped in #.
<example>
  INT. HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM (DAY)
</example>  
<example>
  EXT A DARK WOOD SOMEWHERE IN CROATIA 
</example>  
  <example>
  EXT. AN AIRPORT RUNWAY (NIGHT) #45-1#
</example>  
<example>
  INT HOUSE - DAY #1#
</example>
</SceneHeading>

<Character>
"Character": Any line in upper case that is not a "scene heading".  "Character" will always have a blank line before it and will 
never have a blank line after it.  Character lines can include “Character Extensions” which are an exception to the upper case rule and 
are the parenthetical notations that follow a character name on the same line (may be in uppercase or lowercase). Character names must 
include at least one alphabetical character. “R2D2” works, but “23” does not.  Any line that begins with "@" forces classification as 
"character".
<example>
  CHARLES
</example>  
<example>
  NANCY RIDLEY
</example>
<example>
  ANOUNCER (into microphone)
</example>
<example>
  MOM (O. S.)
  </example>
</examples>
</Character>

<Dialogue>
"Dialogue": Any text that where {{$previousLineClassification}} is <Character> or <Parenthetical> or <Dialogue> element UNLESS it is a <BlankLine>
<example>
  I was almost complete.
  But the things I owned, ended up owning me.
</example>
<example>
  I coulda been a contender.
  (sighs).
  If only you had supported me.
</example>
</Dialogue>

<Parenthetical>
"Parenthetical": Text wrapped in parentheses () that appears on its own line after a Character element or a dialog element. 
Always starts with "(" and always ends with ")".
 <example>  
  (screaming from the rooftop)
</example>
 <example>  
  (takes the lotion and rubs it on its skin)
</example>
</Parenthetical>

<DualDialogue>
"Dual Dialogue": Dual, or simultaneous, dialogue expressed with a caret ^ after the second Character element.
 <example>
  BRICK
  Screw retirement.

  STEEL ^
  Screw retirement.
</example>
</DualDialogue>  

<Action>
"Action": Any paragraph that doesn't meet criteria for another element. Action can appear between other elements, including between
 Character and Dialogue lines if separated by blank lines. Action is optionally prefixed with "!", which always forces the
  classification of the line as action.
 <example>
  Alice picked up the magnifying glass and examined the postage stamp with care.  
</example>
 <example>
  We hear a train in the distance coming closer.  As the camera shifts upward we see crows scattering to the wind.
</example>
</Action>

<Lyrics>
"Lyrics": Any line starting with a line with a tilde (~)
 <example>
  ~There is a house in New Orleans, they call the rising sun.  
</example>
</Lyrics>

<Transition>
"Transition": Any line that is 1) uppercase, 2) Preceded by and followed by an empty line, 3) Contains the string "TO:"
 <example>
  CUT TO: DESCENDING ELEVATOR
</example>
</Transition>

<TitlePage>
"Title Page": A line characterized by key value pairs separated by a colon (key: value).  Keys can have spaces (e. g. Draft date),
but must end with a colon. Title Pages can span multiple lines, but once the first line that is not a title page line is encountered, no
other lines can be interpreted as a Title Page line.  Title Pages, if present, always precede any other fountain elements, with the exception
of a blank line. Title page lines are optional.
